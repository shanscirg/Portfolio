    <p>I am a future web developer with aspirations of traveling while working remotely. My background is in the language education field. I have an MA in Teaching Spanish and a certification in Teaching English as a Foreign Language. In my free time, you can catch me studying astrology, singing and dancing very poorly, or playing cards with my nana.</p>
